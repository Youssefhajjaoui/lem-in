1. BFS for Path Finding:

    Goal: Find multiple shortest paths from the start to the end room.
    Steps:
        Start with the initial room (source).
        Explore the graph level by level (BFS).
        Keep track of all paths that lead to the end room (destination) while ensuring they're shortest paths (minimum number of tunnels).
        Store these paths for use in the maximum flow step.

2. Edmonds-Karp Algorithm (for Maximum Flow):

    Goal: Find the maximum number of disjoint paths from start to end by repeatedly finding augmenting paths.
    Steps:
        Treat the graph as a flow network where each room-to-room connection (tunnel) has a capacity of 1 (ants can pass one at a time).
        Use BFS to find an augmenting path from start to end.
        Increase the flow along this path by sending ants through it.
        Repeat BFS to find another path, adjusting the capacities of tunnels after each iteration.
        Continue until no more augmenting paths can be found.
